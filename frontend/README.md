NeuroCare frontend (Vite + React)

Run locally:

# from project root

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Open: http://127.0.0.1:5173 (or the URL shown by Vite)

Notes:

- Backend API is expected at http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/chat by default.
- If your backend runs on a different port, update `API_URL` in `src/App.jsx`.
